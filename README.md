# Welcome to (WIP) React Portfolio Website!

## Hi my name is Kyle Teopiz

Currently a 2nd Year CS Student at TMU, using my skills in Web Dev and React to build this site and show off other websites!

### CURRENT TO-DO LIST:

#### Styling Choices

- Colour Palette
- Fonts

#### Homepage

- Link HeaderButtons to other webpages when made in the future
- Replace "Home" button text with an Icon
- Begin the main body section, think of Full Intro, and some Nice Graphics

### FUTURE WISHLIST

- Date/Time and Weather API in the Header element for a Utility Type feel up there!
- SVG Element for Logo? Would not mind delving into that again
